# Coding Practice Log

This repository contains my step-by-step solutions to coding challenges.
I focus on:
- Understanding the problem
- Planning and pseudocode
- Implementation in JavaScript
- Complexity analysis (time & space)

## Problem Index

| # | Problem | Source   | Solution File |
|---|----------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Two Sum | LeetCode | [two-sum.md](./two-sum.md) |
| 2 | Repeat String | Codewars | [repeat-string.md](./repeat-string.md) |
| 3 | Remove Spaces from String | Codewars | [remove-spaces.md](./remove-spaces.md) |
| 4 | Even or Odd | Codewars | [even-or-odd.md](./even-or-odd.md) |
| 5 | Positive Sum | Codewars | [positive-sum.md](./positive-sum.md) |
| 6 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | LeetCode | [best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.md](./best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.md) |

## Notes
- Each solution is written in **JavaScript**.  
- Files follow a structured format:
  1. Source  
  2. Problem  
  3. Steps to Solve  
  4. Complexity  
  5. Code  
  6. Alternative Solutions (optional)  
  7. Reflection (optional)

âœ¨ This log helps me track progress and revisit concepts I found difficult (e.g., *Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock*).
